sbt-gzip
==========

[sbt-web] plugin for gzip compressing web assets.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sbt/sbt-gzip.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sbt/sbt-gzip) [![Download](https://api.bintray.com/packages/sbt-web/sbt-plugin-releases/sbt-gzip/images/download.svg)](https://bintray.com/sbt-web/sbt-plugin-releases/sbt-gzip/_latestVersion)

Add plugin
----------

Add the plugin to `project/plugins.sbt`. For example:

```scala
addSbtPlugin("com.typesafe.sbt" % "sbt-unzip" % "1.0.0")
```

Your project's build file also needs to enable sbt-web plugins. For example with build.sbt:

    lazy val root = (project.in file(".")).enablePlugins(SbtWeb)

As with all sbt-web asset pipeline plugins you must declare their order of execution e.g.:

```scala
pipelineStages := Seq(gzip)
```

Configuration
-------------

### Filters

Include and exclude filters can be provided. For example, to only create
gzip files for `.js` files:

```scala
includeFilter in gzip := "*.js"
```

Or to exclude all `.js` files but include any other files:

```scala
excludeFilter in gzip := "*.js"
```

The default filter is to only include `.html`, `.css`, and `.js` files:

```scala
includeFilter in gzip := "*.html" || "*.css" || "*.js"
```
